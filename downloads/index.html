<h1>Download development releases</h1>

<p>
You can download a development relase of MiMMO using Git.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a version control system that is used for
software development and other version control tasks that allows users to
download the very latest version of a project, without having to wait for
someone to get around to packaging it.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
You must have Git installed before you can use it. There are many different
ways to acquire Git, depending on your operating system. For source and official
binaries, check out Git official <a href="https://git-scm.com/">website</a>. For alternative
ways to install Git, use your favorite search engine to find instructions for
your operating system.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>
The first step is to clone the MiMMO repository. This will take a while.
</p>

<p>
In a terminal window, enter the following command:
<span class="codebox">
git clone https://github.com/optimad/MIMMO.git
</span>
This clones the entire MiMMO repository into a subdirectory named MiMMO. To
install into a specific directory, add that to the command line (for more info
refer to these docs). The default "branch" will be master, the cutting-edge,
developer version of MiMMO. Once the repository is cloned, you can easily
switch to different branches or tags (see below), including those tracking
stable versions of MiMMO.
</p>

<h3>Download for development</h3>

<p>
If you have developer access, then instead of cloning anonymously with
https you should clone with your ssh &lt;USERNAME&gt; so that you can submit
changes for review:
<span class="codebox">
git clone https://&lt;USERNAME&gt;&#64;github.com/optimad/MIMMO.git
</span>
</p>

<h2>Choosing MiMMO version</h2>

<h3>Latest development version</h3>

<p>
The latest development version of MiMMO is tracked in the 'master' branch.
This is what is locally checked out by default when you first clone the MiMMO
repository. If you have switched to another branch but would like to switch back
o using bleeding-edge MiMMO, do:
<span class="codebox">
git checkout master
</span>
</p>

<h3>MiMMO tags (stable version)</h3>

<p>Specific stable versions of MiMMO are tracked using 'tags'. These are analogous
to the tarball releases. You can see the versions available with:
<span class="codebox">
git tag -l | grep MIMMO | sort -V
</span>
Using non GNU sort command, such as on Mac OS X, you have to rely on the good
old separators:
<span class="codebox">
git tag -l | grep MIMMO | sort -n -t. -k1 -k2 -k3
</span>
</p>

<p>To use a specific tag:
<span class="codebox">
git checkout &lt;tag name&gt;
</span>
</p>

<h2>Keeping up to date</h2>

<p>If you're using a particular branch or the development version ("master" branch)
of MiMMO, picking up the latest changes is relatively easy. Change into your MiMMO
clone directory and issue the git pull command:
<span class="codebox">
git pull
</span>
All of the latest changes for the branch you are using will be applied.
</p>
